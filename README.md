# ✏️ HTML-CSS-study-plan
This is my version of the HTML & CSS study plan based on my special experience in learning these languages, the only thing that moved me was the motivation to make beautiful pages and I think that **the task of teachers is to motivate to learn** and therefore =>

At the very beginning of the study of HTML and CSS in the first lesson, it will be a great idea to show students simple, minimalistic but _**beautiful**_ examples of sites with an explanation that HTML is content and CSS is style.

# ✏️ Principles to be followed
 - HTML and CSS are always used together, which means that they should also be studied together.
 - The more practice the better.
 - Target popular topics (e.g. Make stores)
 - Always make everything _**beautiful**_ - is the **most important thing**, because only in this way will students feel that they are doing something cool and be motivated, and in the end we learn to make a visual, and a visual should be beautiful !!!

# HTML-CSS-study-plan
This is my version of the HTML & CSS study plan based on my special experience in learning these languages, the only thing that moved me was the motivation to make beautiful pages and I think that the task of teachers is to motivate to learn and therefore =>

At the very beginning of the study of html and css in the first lesson, it will be a great idea to show students simple, minimalistic but _**beautiful**_ examples of sites with an explanation that HTML is content and CSS is style.

## Introduction
### Topics to study
 - Basic HTML tags (simple page without styles that will have _**p, img, div, b, i, input, btn, h1**_ etc. tags)
 - Basic concepts of CSS (like: _**background color, text color, margin, padding, border**_)
 
### Project examples: 
 - _**Article**_ - simple article without styles (using only basic HTML tags)
 - _**Tag book**_ - Students own page divided into two parts - HTML & CSS, where students can save the title, description, code, and picture of the result of the tag or style
